// Question 1 - Similar to base question 1 (n+5=5)
@question If $m+7=7$, what is the value of $m$?
@instruction Solve for the variable m in the given equation
@difficulty easy
@Order 1
@option 0
@option $\frac{1}{7}$
@option 1
@option 7
@@option 0
@explanation 
To solve $m+7=7$, subtract 7 from both sides: $m+7-7=7-7$, which gives $m=0$.
