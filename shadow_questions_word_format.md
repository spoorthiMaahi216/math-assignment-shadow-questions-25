## Question 22
**Question:** If a number $k$ is divisible by 6, which of the following expressions must be an integer?

**Instructions:** Apply divisibility rules to determine which expression is always an integer

**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1

**Options:**
A) $\frac{k}{8}$  
B) $\frac{k+6}{6}$  
C) $\frac{2k}{3}$  
D) $\frac{k+3}{9}$  

**Correct Answer:** C) $\frac{2k}{3}$

**Explanation:** If $k$ is divisible by 6, then $k = 6n$ for some integer $n$. So $\frac{2k}{3} = \frac{2(6n)}{3} = \frac{12n}{3} = 4n$, which is always an integer.

## Question 23
**Question:** On Monday, Elena reads $\frac{1}{4}$ of a novel, and on Tuesday, she reads $\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining pages. To finish the book, she must read an additional 80 pages. How many pages are in the novel?

**[IMAGE NEEDED: Book with pages being read, showing Monday (1/4), Tuesday (1/3 of remaining), and 80 pages left]**

**Instructions:** Set up an equation to find the total number of pages

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Points:** 1

**Options:**
A) 120  
B) 160  
C) 200  
D) 240  

**Correct Answer:** B) 160

**Explanation:** Let $x$ be the total pages. Monday: $\frac{x}{4}$ pages read, leaving $\frac{3x}{4}$. Tuesday: $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3x}{4} = \frac{x}{4}$ pages read. Total read: $\frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{2}$. Remaining: $x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} = 80$, so $x = 160$.

## Question 24
**Question:** A square piece of paper has an area of 100 square inches. What is the circumference, in inches, of the largest circle that can be cut from the paper?

**[IMAGE NEEDED: Square paper with area 100 sq in, and largest possible circle drawn inside it with diameter equal to side length]**

**Instructions:** Find the diameter of the largest possible circle and calculate its circumference

**Points:** 1

**Options:**
A) $10\pi$  
B) $20\pi$  
C) $25\pi$  
D) $50\pi$  

**Correct Answer:** A) $10\pi$

**Explanation:** The side length of the square is $\sqrt{100} = 10$ inches. The largest circle has diameter equal to the side length, so diameter = 10 inches. Circumference = $\pi \times$ diameter = $10\pi$ inches.

## Question 25
**Question:** The number 200 is increased by $40\%$, and the result is then decreased by $25\%$ to give the number $y$. What is the value of $y$?

**[IMAGE NEEDED: Number line or bar chart showing 200, then 40% increase to 280, then 25% decrease to final value]**

**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1

**Options:**
A) 180  
B) 210  
C) 240  
D) 280  

**Correct Answer:** B) 210

**Explanation:** First increase: $200 + 0.4(200) = 200 + 80 = 280$. Then decrease: $280 - 0.25(280) = 280 - 70 = 210$. So $y = 210$.
