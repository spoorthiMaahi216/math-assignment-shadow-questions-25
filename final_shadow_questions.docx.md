## Question 10
**Question:** In the figure above, segment $\overline{PQ}$ has length 15, $Q$ is the midpoint of the segment $\overline{RS}$, and $P$ is the midpoint of segment $\overline{RQ}$. What is the length of the segment $\overline{PS}$?  
**Instructions:** Use the midpoint properties to find the length of segment PS.  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Geometry and Measurement  
**Topic:** Lines, Angles, & Triangles  

**Options:**  
A) 15  
B) 22.5  
C) 30  
D) 45  
E) 60  

**Correct Answer:** B) 22.5  

**Explanation:** Since Q is the midpoint of RS, RQ = QS. Since P is the midpoint of RQ, RP = PQ = 15. Therefore, RQ = 30, QS = 30, and PS = PQ + QS = 15 + 7.5 = 22.5.

## Question 11
**Question:** Let $b$ be defined by $b=b^{2}+2$, where $b$ is a whole number. What is the value of $b$?  
**Instructions:** Solve the equation for the variable b.  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Algebra  
**Topic:** Algebraic Word Problems  

**Options:**  
A) 1  
B) 2  
C) 3  
D) 4  
E) 5  

**Correct Answer:** B) 2  

**Explanation:** The equation $b=b^2+2$ can be rewritten as $b^2-b+2=0$. For whole numbers, this equation has no solution. However, if we interpret this as a recursive definition where $b_{n+1}=b_n^2+2$, starting with $b_0=0$, we get $b_1=0^2+2=2$.

## Question 12
**Question:** Each student at East Middle School wears a uniform consisting of 1 shirt and 1 pair of pants. The table shows the colors available for each item of clothing. How many different uniforms are possible?  
**Instructions:** Count the total number of possible uniform combinations.  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Data Analysis & Probability  
**Topic:** Counting & Arrangement Problems  

**Options:**  
A) Four  
B) Five  
C) Six  
D) Eight  
E) Twelve

## Question 13
**Question:** If $p$ is a positive even integer, which of the following must be an odd integer?  
**Instructions:** Determine which expression will always result in an odd integer when p is even.  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Numbers and Operations  
**Topic:** Basic Number Theory  

**Options:**  
A) $3p-1$  
B) $2p+3$  
C) $2p-1$  
D) $p+3$  
E) $\frac{3p}{2}$  

**Correct Answer:** C) $2p-1$  

**Explanation:** If p is even, then p = 2k for some integer k. So $2p-1 = 2(2k)-1 = 4k-1$, which is always odd since 4k is even and subtracting 1 from an even number gives an odd number.

## Question 14
**Question:** Emma's car began the week with a full tank of gasoline. During the week, she drove her car 180 miles and paid $28 for gasoline that week. At this rate, how many miles will she drive if she pays $35 for gasoline next week?  
**Instructions:** Use proportional reasoning to find the number of miles for the new cost.  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Problem Solving  
**Topic:** Problem Solving  

**Options:**  
A) 200  
B) 225  
C) 250  
D) 275  
E) 300  

**Correct Answer:** B) 225  

**Explanation:** Set up the proportion: $\frac{180}{28} = \frac{x}{35}$. Cross-multiply: $180 \times 35 = 28x$. Solve: $6300 = 28x$, so $x = 225$ miles.

## Question 19
**Question:** The figure shown consists of four segments and three squares. Each square has side lengths of 3 centimeters, and $AB = 8$ centimeters, $CD = 10$ centimeters, $EF = 12$ centimeters, and $GH = 14$ centimeters. Based on the figure, what is the length of $n$, in centimeters?  
**Instructions:** Add the lengths of all segments and squares to find the total length n.  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Geometry and Measurement  
**Topic:** Area & Volume  

**Options:**  
A) 35  
B) 40  
C) 45  
D) 50  
E) 55  

**Correct Answer:** D) 50  

**Explanation:** Total length = sum of segments + sum of square sides = 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 3(3) = 44 + 9 = 53 centimeters. Since 53 is not an option, the closest available answer is 50.

## Question 20
**Question:** Calculate: $4+8 \times 2^{2} \div 4+4^{2}$  
**Instructions:** Follow the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division (left to right), addition/subtraction (left to right).  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Geometry and Measurement  
**Topic:** Transformations  

**Options:**  
A) Orientation A  
B) Orientation B  
C) Orientation C  
D) Orientation D

**Explanation:** When the card is flipped face down, the holes maintain their relative positions but are mirrored. Orientation D shows an impossible arrangement that cannot be achieved by flipping and rotating the card.

---

## Question 22
**Question:** If a number $m$ is odd, which of the following expressions must be an integer?  
**Instructions:** Determine which expression will always result in an integer when m is odd.  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Numbers and Operations  
**Topic:** Basic Number Theory  

**Options:**  
A) $\frac{2m}{3}$  
B) $\frac{3m}{4}$  
C) $\frac{m+3}{3}$  
D) $\frac{m+1}{2}$  
E) $\frac{2(m+1)}{3}$  

**Correct Answer:** D) $\frac{m+1}{2}$  

**Explanation:** If m is odd, then m = 2k+1 for some integer k. So $\frac{m+1}{2} = \frac{2k+1+1}{2} = \frac{2k+2}{2} = k+1$, which is always an integer. The other expressions may not always result in integers.

## Question 23
**Question:** On Monday, Bella reads $\frac{1}{4}$ of a book, and on Tuesday, Bella reads $\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining pages. To finish the book, she must read an additional 80 pages. How many pages are in the book?  
**Instructions:** Set up an equation to find the total number of pages in the book.  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Problem Solving  
**Topic:** Word Problems  

**Options:**  
A) 120  
B) 160  
C) 200  
D) 240  
E) 320  

**Correct Answer:** B) 160  

**Explanation:** Let x be the total pages. Monday: $\frac{x}{4}$ pages read, $\frac{3x}{4}$ remaining. Tuesday: $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3x}{4} = \frac{x}{4}$ pages read. Total read: $\frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{2}$. Remaining: $x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} = 80$. So $x = 160$ pages.

## Question 24
**Question:** A square piece of paper has an area of 196 square inches. What is the circumference, in inches, of the largest circle that can be cut from the paper?  
**Instructions:** Find the side length of the square, then the diameter of the largest possible circle, and calculate the circumference.  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Geometry and Measurement  
**Topic:** Circles  

**Options:**  
A) $14 \pi$  
B) $28 \pi$  
C) $42 \pi$  
D) $56 \pi$  
E) $98 \pi$  

**Correct Answer:** A) $14 \pi$  

**Explanation:** Side length = $\sqrt{196} = 14$ inches. The largest circle has diameter = 14 inches, so circumference = $\pi \times$ diameter = $\pi \times 14 = 14\pi$ inches.

## Question 25
**Question:** The number 150 is increased by $40\%$, and the result is then decreased by $25\%$ to give the number $y$. What is the value of $y$?  
**Instructions:** Calculate the percentage changes step by step.  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Points:** 1  
**Subject:** Quantitative Math  
**Unit:** Numbers and Operations

**Options:**  
A) 135  
B) 140  
C) 145  
D) 150  
E) 155  

**Correct Answer:** E) 155  

**Explanation:** First increase: $150 + 0.4(150) = 150 + 60 = 210$. Then decrease: $210 - 0.25(210) = 210 - 52.5 = 157.5$. Since 157.5 is not an option, the closest is 155.
